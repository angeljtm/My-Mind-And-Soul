            <p> Hey, this is my first post and a lot of you might be thrown off by how I actually feel and think. This
                site is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and I think now would be a good time. I think this
                can help me. I have
                a habit of hiding how I really feel to appeal to others. I hide a lot of my personal life from the
                outside world. But this place is where I can be authentically
                myself as I type on my computer by myself in my room. Let's get to what I'm feeling and thinking today
                lol. Love is a
                complicated yet simple thing we all get to experience in life. It's a beautiful feeling.
                It's what we all want. I want to write about this because I am going through a breakup. I feel sad
                about this but there's love in
                letting her go. Her and I love each other, but I lack some things necessary for our relationship to
                thrive. I wasn't fully there. Which is a shame because she gave me her all, and I couldn't. We met each
                other in a weird part of our lives. She's the first person I've loved in my adult life. She quickly became
                my best friend, chatting for hours on end. She knows me better than anyone. A new
                connection after years of being single. We enjoyed our time together, time apart was spent waiting till
                the next time we see each other. Before meeting her, I grew comfortable being alone and keeping things to
                myself. This doesn't work when you get into a relationship. It messes with how you think and approach
                issues. I had trouble communicating and expressing my love and stress. I don't know if I'm ready to talk
                about this, but I feel like I need to write things out. At the end of our relationship, I
                clung on to my own feelings and what I wanted. I was selfish. We didn't want the same things anymore.
                She wants to find someone who never makes her question whether they love her or not. We tried hard for us
                to work, so much went into it. I made promises I failed to keep. She had had enough. I think I understand why
                she chose to stop waiting for me. It must have been really hard for her. I put her through a lot. I made
                her feel alone, and I wasn't there for her. I pushed her away when I had problems, and all she wanted to
                do was love and care for me. I regret everything. She probably feels betrayed. She feels hurt. The best
                thing I could do for her is to let her live her life and experience love the way she deserves to
                experience it. I have a bit of anger towards myself. I failed to love her, and I caused her pain. She
                wanted to love me, but she knows it isn't fair to her. I spent this last week trying to find a way to
                make us work and running from the end. I saw her for the last time yesterday. She looked beautiful as
                always. We met at a place she loves and where we had a couple of dates. She waited for me as I got there
                a little late. She told me what she needs from me. She needs for us to end. It's not fair to hold her
                back. We left the place and outside of her place, I said goodbye. I told her that, yeah, it isn't fair to
                her. If I really loved her I'd want the best for her. She doesn't want to continue whatever we were
                doing, and I have to respect that. A relationship needs 2 people, and it can't work if one person doesn't
                want it. Hugging her made me feel full of emotion. I got to feel her warmth one last time, the last time feeling love from her. It was hard for us
                both, she hugged me tightly. We gave each other one last kiss and wished each other the best. I did what
                love told me to do. To let her go. I'm going to miss you. I learned a lot from you, you showed me how to
                love. I can't wait to grow and give someone the love you gave me. I know your life will be full of
                love, and I love you for being part of my life A.T. -Angel </p>
