            <p> I'm a pile of shit. I really am selfish. What the fuck was I thinking. Why do I do this? What was I going to achieve today? I did the opposite of what I needed to do. I'm a crazy overreactor. An over thinker, I live in my own fucking world. I am ashamed of today. I am ashamed of myself. I really thought I could do something. I do things that don't benefit anyone. I need to move on. I have no reason to be trying to be in her life anymore. I hurt her, and I keep on doing it. I'm a weirdo. I'm worse than her ex. I can't believe I'm worse than her fucking ex. I'm giving up, I should've given up earlier. I've been scared to feel sad and alone. I'm a fucking loser. Pathetic. I can't keep doing this to myself and her. I'm getting rid of everything that makes me do this stupid shit. I'm going to stop this blog for a while. I'll be back someday. I have serious issues that I need to address, I need to be normal. I can't act on everything. Phone off. Everything off. I'm disappointed in myself, it's done. I'm done. I'm sorry guys, I am genuinely a bad person. I need to ground myself. Bye. </p>

            <p> I'm feeling really lonely today. I've been feeling lonely a lot recently. I thought I would be over this feeling by now, but recently I've been feeling it so much. I don't know why I keep feeling like this. I want to say it's because I miss her. I think of her so much. I miss her voice. I miss holding her hand. I wish I could be at a park with her enjoying this weather. I think I'm the only one who feels this. I am so sad. I want her... I miss the feelings I had when I was with her. I miss the nights we spent together, the messages we shared, the connection we had, the love and care we had for each other. I want to do everything in my power to get back with her. But I know I can't. I am very impulsive. I know I'm going to slip up and try to contact her. I know I can't but I get so overwhelmed with emotions, and I let it take over and do things I regret. She's been in my dream every single night since the breakup. I wish she weren't around only in my dreams. I wish she'd want to contact me as much as I want to contact her. My feelings aren't mutual.//////Pt 2. Right now it's 9:10. I heard what I needed to hear. I think I did the right thing today. I got to end it how it should've. I think I satisfied my heart today. I thought and wrote what I felt today after the first part and remembered why it ended. There's nothing to fix, we both know that. I'm excited for what lies ahead for me. I'm excited for her too. We have lots of goals in life and no matter where we are in life, I know I'll be wishing her the best and be her biggest supporter. I love you Aileen, you genuinely deserve great things. It's going to be hard for a little while longer to move one, but that's okay. In the end, I'll be okay and exactly where I need to be. Maybe we meet again, maybe we don't. It's best not to worry and stress about it. We have to live our lives. -Angel </p>

            <p> I didn't feel good today. I woke up missing everything that I had just a couple of weeks ago. I know people have lots of relationships during this period of life, but it's hard for me to move on lol. I don't want to be part of hook-up culture or anything of that sort. I met my ex on a dating app, but I don't think I want to be on those anymore. It also gives me a weird feeling in my stomach just thinking about her talking to someone else. I think I still love her, maybe I'm being selfish and it's some other feeling. Sometimes I wish we still loved each other. I don't know what to do lol. I don't plan on reaching out and doing anything stupid anymore. Funny thing is I've been scared to wash her smell away from sweaters that she gave back to me. I'm doing laundry today, so I'm kinda upset about that. She smelled like a flower garden, she smelled like the word beautiful. Sucks I have to wash it away. I'm just hoping I get busy enough not to think about any of this. I got accepted to the school I wanted to go to in the bay. I'm excited for that. I get to start brand new once I leave. Basically Silicon Valley, not a long drive to San Jose or San Francisco. It's gonna give me so many opportunities to find a tech Job. A chance to live a new life. A new place where I get to meet new people who may have an impact on my life. It's kind of scary too though, I don't know what to expect. Maybe that's the beauty in it. Short one today, just felt like I needed to write something out. Time to go back to studying for my exam and doing laundry. I will be okay. - Angel</p>

            <p> I usually don't remember my dreams. But I know she was in it the other day. I miss her, but now I've gotten used to that feeling. I don't feel the urge to chase her, I don't have a weird stomach feeling telling me I need her, and I know I will be okay. I still wish I had done everything right that night. She told me what was on her mind and how she was feeling. I just acted like it was my time to share too, and basically belittled her feelings. But that's really all it is anymore, it's just me wishing I had done something differently. I love what we had. I appreciate what I had. I know it's better off for both of us to break up. This whole past week was filled with lots of tears, and some nights I felt like I cried out all the liquid in my body. I'm in a much better position than I was last week. I know I'm going to be okay. I have to enjoy the small things and appreciate everything. I got an apology off my chest today to some people that I felt needed one and it felt good. The clinic she referred me to got back to me today, it's full and the wait would be 2-3 months. I will have to find other places near me or that take my insurance. So that's the bad info from these past couple of days. But overall, I'm really excited to grow. All my applications are in, waiting to hear back from one university. Getting back into running and reading, gonna get therapy at some point. Birthday is in a month and I don't know how I want to spend it just yet. We'll see what I do that day, will probably just go to a bar and get a drink by myself or something, I don't know. My Apple Maps still recommends heading towards her. Not exactly her place, but there's a "flower shop" or something like that, and it keeps recommending it as a place to travel to since I would frequently visit that area. Kinda funny but yeah. Life goes on. I've got so much more stuff in life to experience. Maybe our paths will meet again. But for now, I must keep on moving. I will see you guys on Wednesday, till then. -Angel  </p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p> I didn't have time to write a post yesterday. Did some homework and went out with some friends to play basketball. I don't know what exactly I did, but I ended up hurting my back. Hurts quite a bit, but nothing too serious. I might change the frequency I upload here. Minimum 2 posts a week, but we will have to see. I was trying to keep myself busy all day. I am really excited for these upcoming months. I have already been accepted to a CSU near the Bay Area. Many schools I wanted to attend have already closed applications, so as long as I get accepted to one that I like near Silicon Valley, I'll end up transferring next semester. I still think of her every now and then. I'll be okay. Wish I could be celebrating with her. But I doubt she thinks of me, and she doesn't really have a reason to. I had every chance to change for myself during the relationship, but I always made promises I didn't keep. To be loved is to be changed. She changed as much as she could to try to love me, but I didn't do the same, which I really regret. I still hate how it ended. I can't do anything about it anymore, I tried fixing something that she didn't want. I can fix my issues now, but it sucks that I can't show her how I really wanted to love her. It's okay, I know she'll be loved by the next. I'll love the next person too and hope I'll be ready. Life goes on. I don't know why I type stuff like that. The last thing she said was that she hated me and it makes me wonder if I deserve to talk about us like this. Am I a weirdo? I don't know. Right now, I have to focus on school for the last couple of weeks of the semester. Then work a summer job and get ready to leave home. This next chapter in my life is going to launch me into adulthood. I'm going to learn to adapt to living in a new place and make new friends. I'm actually so excited for what's to come. Keeping this one short and sweet. See ya guys. -Angel  </p>

        <div class="post-date">May 1, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p> I remembered her today. Woke up and grabbed my glasses to get ready for class. Saw Birdie's teeth marks on my glasses. He always played around with my stuff and rubbed himself on me because he wanted me to play with him. I guess he must've bitten my glasses at some point. I have a slight allergy to cats and pushed him off me a lot, but I sort of miss him annoying me. I miss coming home with cat hair. I'm feeling a bit more accepting of what is going on. I miss her, but I don't feel like acting on it. I appreciate what happened between us. I have a lot of regret on how it ended, but I know why it ended and accept it. My feelings have a habit of swinging back and forth, but right now I feel okay. I overthink, and then I overreact. We had a fun relationship, wish it could've lasted forever but that doesn't always happen. It's something she understands and something I need to understand. Sometimes it's easier to start over than fix something. You can say if there's love, there's a way, but I wasn't the best BF to her, and maybe that forced her to stop loving me as much as she wanted to and decide that it's over. I do admit, if today were my last day on earth and if she'd let me, I would spend it with her. I had a little talk to myself today on my drive home and looked back at why I started running. Running sucked and was hard on my body, but I used it as a way to run away from my thoughts. It gave me something to focus on and grind and pushed me to achieve things I never thought I could do. It was a form of healing. It kept me busy. It kept me from thinking about a relationship. I need to find things to keep myself busy. Life is about keeping yourself busy. Whether it's a hobby, work, school, or something else. I also see how people can become dependent on drugs after a difficult period in their lives. I threw all of my weed away on 4/21/2025. At least that's what I thought I did. I found my joint holder, and I had 2 left. I smoked one with my friends, and I smoked one yesterday. I didn't feel proud of myself for doing it. I want to smoke less, it's something that I want to do for myself. I don't hate smokers, I get why most of them do it. heck, I did it a lot. But it's something I'd like to stop. So I regret doing it. I have no more weed and plan on keeping it that way. But it kept me distracted, and I see why people use drugs after problems in their lives. I sat in my bed, just keeping myself distracted by watching whatever YouTube gave me. I didn't think about her. I would for a split second, but then go back to focusing on my video. I don't want to hide from my feelings. I want to sit in them. I think I'm doing okay. I know in some cases I'm not, but I know I'll be okay. I know that loving her is respecting her wishes, and she wanted to finish it. If I do love her, this is the bare minimum I can do. She's always gonna occupy a piece of my heart, but I also have so much more to give. Still waiting to hear back from the therapist clinic I applied to, I'm going to start checking out more local spots. I spoke to my mom about it, and she supports it. I can't run away from my problems. I need to learn to properly address them. This blog (more like a journal) really helps me not hold these things in. I feel relieved letting stuff out. Maybe I have one reader, maybe I have none. I like not knowing. See ya guys later. -Angel </p>

        <div class="post-date">April 30, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p> I don't know if I am allowed to miss her this much. Am I allowed to feel bad? Am I allowed to miss her? Am I allowed to hope she thinks of me? Am I allowed to wish I can go back in time and not mess up and love her right and show her off to the world? I've only known her since August of last year. But she's made such a large impact on my life in that short time. I went to the strawberry market at Riverpark yesterday to get this one chicken sandwich. I wanted to go there with her. So it hurt even going. I know she likes going there with her siblings, and I was scared to run into her. I had trouble breathing. I was too scared to look around. The funny thing is, after getting my sandwich, I didn't even have the appetite to eat it. I just sat there looking at it, and I spent that time just writing in my journal. I wrote about regret. She wrote me a beautiful letter. She called me her sweet boy. I don't think I'm that to her anymore. I regret trying to get back with her one more time after that. It just proved I'm selfish and pushed her away. When do I move on? I get bad anxiety. I feel weird. I wish I could hold her hand and hear her say I'll be okay. Am I strange and weird for not knowing when I'll be over her? I assume she'll get over me faster since she was the one getting hurt. Maybe she already has. She's a very lovable person. She had me obsessed over her lol, maybe not in a good way since it's over. I miss her still. She gave me a side of her that she shares with people she loves and trusts, and I took it for granted. I hate what I have done. I don't think I'll be able to forgive myself for a while. I really had it all. She was there for me, and I just couldn't see. I didn't want this. I don't want to become strangers with her. Act like I never knew her. But I let this happen. Sometimes I wake up hoping to have a text from her. It's sad and pathetic how I'm acting. I just miss feeling loved like how she loved me. Her family welcomed me with open arms. I'm only remembering the good. I know I messed up. There's stuff I look over and I know I could've done better. Emotionally messed up a lot. Made her feel alone sometimes. In the end, I disrespected our boundaries. My first relationship in years. My first adult relationship. I tried. I'm going to miss you, and that's okay. I hope to love my next partner the way you loved me. Maybe one day we can talk about this. Maybe we won't, it's okay. I'm starting to accept this a bit more day by day. -Angel </p>

            <p> I don't know how to feel. I can't describe it. I don't like this feeling. I feel sort of sad, mad, embarrassed, and tired. I've lost 10 pounds since all this has happened. I haven't had an appetite in a while. I'm going through this day by day. I threw everything away today. I had a bag full of stuff given back to me and kept it in my closet until today. I think I did the right thing. Filled the bag with receipts from our dates, cards she gave me, just memories I wanted to cherish for us. I looked at our pictures one last time. I enjoyed my time with her and cried a couple of happy and sad tears. I read the cards she gave me. She loved me. I changed a lot with her. Some good but a bit bad too. I stopped trying as hard as I did in the beginning. I became happy and fulfilled with how she cared for me, but I just didn't keep bringing the energy she needed. I did what I thought was enough, but it wasn't fair to her. I need to move on and let her live her life, so I deleted our pictures from my phone and threw polaroids in the trash. It hurt. But this is what I need to do. I need to move one. I can't keep hurting myself thinking about this, but I do want to sit in this feeling for a while, just to reflect and look at what I need to do to change and understand how I affect others. There's gonna be a lot of changes, I have to be comfortable with that. No more good morning texts, no more good nights, no more her. Hard to do when the clock hits 2:22 because I just think of her any time I see 222. I've seen it a lot recently. Maybe I'm just looking for it harder. I have a whole lotta life ahead of me. I need to work towards that. I can miss, but that's it. We had something, now we don't. Gotta keep moving forward. I'm actually really looking forward to therapy, I have so much to talk about and work on. I keep remembering that she said she hates me. I want to think she said it out of frustration and anger. But I have to take it at face value, she hates me. I disrespected her space. Sucks so so much, but I hurt her. I deleted Instagram from my phone. I need this. I'm a big overthinker. Let's talk about something different for once. I had a little problem yesterday when I realised I had made a CSU account but had never applied to schools, only to UCs. So that was awkward because I applied to schools but got rejected from every single one, but got waitlisted to UCSD. Was going to use fresno state as my back up but I fucked that up too. Luckily, some schools still are taking applications, so I sent some in, just Hail Marys. Lots of changes are coming, I've got to adapt to my new story. I miss you, I hope you're surrounded by people who love you and are keeping you busy. I'll be fine. Everything will be okay. Angel out. </p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p> I fucked up today. I fucked up so fucking big time. I keep self-sabotaging myself. I missed her yesterday and today. I would see a post and I would think of her. I would think of something and want to share it with her, but I let it get the best of me. I reached out to her. We had our conclusion, but I still decided to reach out. I wrote a letter hoping to change her mind like an idiot the night before, and I made a bouquet and brought it to her today. She has made up her mind, and I acted selfishly. I need help. I need to stop doing things impulsively. I miss her, but I shouldn't be acting on it. I waited outside her door with flowers even though we had said our goodbyes, hoping something could happen between us. I received a message from her telling me to leave and that I was doing exactly what her ex did. She's right. He didn't leave her alone, I'm doing the same. I couldn't believe it at first because I remember talking about how he was weird for that, but I'm doing the same. It's the last thing I want. I saw how unsafe she felt because of him. I'm doing the same, and I hate it. What am I even doing? Why do I keep hurting her? Why can't I accept it and move on? I'm not doing it out of love anymore, I tell myself I am but the reality is I'm doing it for myself because I'm scared for her to leave, and I'm obsessed. I'm making her hate me. I made her uncomfortable. She said I'm selfish for not respecting her boundaries and not caring for what she wants. She's right. I am obsessed with her and let my own desires do the stuff and I don't think. I can't keep doing this to her. She said she hates me. That really hurt me. Because it made me realise that I hate myself too. I can't let her just live her life. All I have to do is just not contact her and let her live her life. But I fuck it up. We had a good end. But I threw that goodbye in the trash and made her hate and resent me, and I'm sorry. I have to stop. I'm acting like a creep. I deleted her contact, I deleted our Instagram messages, and as a result of today, I am blocked on everything. I feel weird talking about this. It's stuff about me and her, and I basically just harassed her. I don't want to believe it, but the reality is that I have just done that. I'm going to get help. Before everything, she recommended me this one therapist clinic. I've sent a request and I've been waiting to hear back for a while now. I'm unwell and I need to get help. I need to work on myself mentally. I'm a fucking mess. I became what she feared. I became something I hate. I'm sorry. -Angel </p>

        <div class="post-date">April 27, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p> Hey, this is my first post and a lot of you might be thrown off by how I actually feel and think. This
                site is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and I think now would be a good time. I think this
                can help me. I have
                a habit of hiding how I really feel to appeal to others. I hide a lot of my personal life from the
                outside world. But this place is where I can be authentically
                myself as I type on my computer by myself in my room. Let's get to what I'm feeling and thinking today
                lol. Love is a
                complicated yet simple thing we all get to experience in life. It's a beautiful feeling.
                It's what we all want. I want to write about this because I am going through a breakup. I feel sad
                about this but there's love in
                letting her go. Her and I love each other, but I lack some things necessary for our relationship to
                thrive. I wasn't fully there. Which is a shame because she gave me her all, and I couldn't. We met each
                other in a weird part of our lives. She's the first person I've loved in my adult life. She quickly became
                my best friend, chatting for hours on end. She knows me better than anyone. A new
                connection after years of being single. We enjoyed our time together, time apart was spent waiting till
                the next time we see each other. Before meeting her, I grew comfortable being alone and keeping things to
                myself. This doesn't work when you get into a relationship. It messes with how you think and approach
                issues. I had trouble communicating and expressing my love and stress. I don't know if I'm ready to talk
                about this, but I feel like I need to write things out. At the end of our relationship, I
                clung on to my own feelings and what I wanted. I was selfish. We didn't want the same things anymore.
                She wants to find someone who never makes her question whether they love her or not. We tried hard for us
                to work, so much went into it. I made promises I failed to keep. She had had enough. I think I understand why
                she chose to stop waiting for me. It must have been really hard for her. I put her through a lot. I made
                her feel alone, and I wasn't there for her. I pushed her away when I had problems, and all she wanted to
                do was love and care for me. I regret everything. She probably feels betrayed. She feels hurt. The best
                thing I could do for her is to let her live her life and experience love the way she deserves to
                experience it. I have a bit of anger towards myself. I failed to love her, and I caused her pain. She
                wanted to love me, but she knows it isn't fair to her. I spent this last week trying to find a way to
                make us work and running from the end. I saw her for the last time yesterday. She looked beautiful as
                always. We met at a place she loves and where we had a couple of dates. She waited for me as I got there
                a little late. She told me what she needs from me. She needs for us to end. It's not fair to hold her
                back. We left the place and outside of her place, I said goodbye. I told her that, yeah, it isn't fair to
                her. If I really loved her I'd want the best for her. She doesn't want to continue whatever we were
                doing, and I have to respect that. A relationship needs 2 people, and it can't work if one person doesn't
                want it. Hugging her made me feel full of emotion. I got to feel her warmth one last time, the last time feeling love from her. It was hard for us
                both, she hugged me tightly. We gave each other one last kiss and wished each other the best. I did what
                love told me to do. To let her go. I'm going to miss you. I learned a lot from you, you showed me how to
                love. I can't wait to grow and give someone the love you gave me. I know your life will be full of
                love, and I love you for being part of my life A.T. -Angel </p>
