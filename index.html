            <p> I don't know how to feel. I can't describe it. I don't like this feeling. I feel sort of sad, mad, embarrassed, and tired. I've lost 10 pounds since all this has happened. I haven't had an appetite in a while. I'm going through this day by day. I threw everything away today. I had a bag full of stuff given back to me and kept it in my closet until today. I think I did the right thing. Filled the bag with receipts from our dates, cards she gave me, just memories I wanted to cherish for us. I looked at our pictures one last time. I enjoyed my time with her and cried a couple of happy and sad tears. I read the cards she gave me. She loved me. I changed a lot with her. Some good but a bit bad too. I stopped trying as hard as I did in the beginning. I became happy and fulfilled with how she cared for me, but I just didn't do as much as she did. I need to move on and let her live her life, so I deleted our pictures from my phone and threw polaroids in the trash. It hurt. But this is what I need to do. I need to move one. I can't keep hurting myself thinking about this, but I do want to sit in this feeling for a while, just to reflect and look at what I need to do to change and understand how I affect others. There's gonna be a lot of changes, I have to be comfortable with that. No more good morning texts, no more good nights, no more her. I have a whole lotta life ahead of me. I need to work towards that. I can miss but that's it. Gotta keep moving forward. I'm actually really looking forward to therapy, I have so much to talk about and work on. I keep remembering that she said she hates me. Maybe she said it out of frustration and anger. But I have to take it as face value, she just hates me. Sucks so so much, but I hurt her. I deleted Instagram from my phone. I need this. I had a little problem yesterday when I realised I made a CSU account but never applied to schools, only to UCs. So that was awkward because I applied to schools but got rejected from every one but got waitlisted to UCSD. Was going to use fresno state as my back up but I fucked that up too. Luckily, some schools still are taking applications, so I sent some in, just Hail Marys. Lots of changes coming, got to adapt to my new story. I miss you, I hope you're surrounded by people who love you and are keeping you busy. I'll be fine. Everything will be okay. Angel out. </p>

            <p> I fucked up today. I fucked up so fucking big time. I keep self-sabotaging myself. I missed her yesterday and today. I would see a post and I would think of her. I would think of something and want to share it with her, but I let it get the best of me. I reached out to her. We had our conclusion, but I still decided to reach out. I wrote a letter hoping to change her mind like an idiot the night before, and I made a bouquet and brought it to her today. She has made up her mind, and I acted selfishly. I need help. I need to stop doing things impulsively. I miss her, but I shouldn't be acting on it. I waited outside her door with flowers even though we had said our goodbyes, hoping something could happen between us. I received a message from her telling me to leave and that I was doing exactly what her ex did. She's right. He didn't leave her alone, I'm doing the same. I couldn't believe it at first because I remember talking about how he was weird for that, but I'm doing the same. It's the last thing I want. I saw how unsafe she felt because of him. I'm doing the same, and I hate it. What am I even doing? Why do I keep hurting her? Why can't I accept it and move on? I'm not doing it out of love anymore, I tell myself I am but the reality is I'm doing it for myself because I'm scared for her to leave, and I'm obsessed. I'm making her hate me. I made her uncomfortable. She said I'm selfish for not respecting her boundaries and not caring for what she wants. She's right. I am obsessed with her and let my own desires do the stuff and I don't think. I can't keep doing this to her. She said she hates me. That really hurt me. Because it made me realise that I hate myself too. I can't let her just live her life. All I have to do is just not contact her and let her live her life. But I fuck it up. We had a good end. But I threw that goodbye in the trash and made her hate and resent me, and I'm sorry. I have to stop. I'm acting like a creep. I deleted her contact, I deleted our Instagram messages, and as a result of today, I am blocked on everything. I feel weird talking about this. It's stuff about me and her, and I basically just harassed her. I don't want to believe it, but the reality is that I have just done that. I'm going to get help. Before everything, she recommended me this one therapist clinic. I've sent a request and I've been waiting to hear back for a while now. I'm unwell and I need to get help. I need to work on myself mentally. I'm a fucking mess. I became what she feared. I became something I hate. I'm sorry. -Angel </p>

        <div class="post-date">April 27, 2025</div>
        <div class="post-content">
            <p> Hey, this is my first post and a lot of you might be thrown off by how I actually feel and think. This
                site is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and I think now would be a good time. I think this
                can help me. I have
                a habit of hiding how I really feel to appeal to others. I hide a lot of my personal life from the
                outside world. But this place is where I can be authentically
                myself as I type on my computer by myself in my room. Let's get to what I'm feeling and thinking today
                lol. Love is a
                complicated yet simple thing we all get to experience in life. It's a beautiful feeling.
                It's what we all want. I want to write about this because I am going through a breakup. I feel sad
                about this but there's love in
                letting her go. Her and I love each other, but I lack some things necessary for our relationship to
                thrive. I wasn't fully there. Which is a shame because she gave me her all, and I couldn't. We met each
                other in a weird part of our lives. She's the first person I've loved in my adult life. She quickly became
                my best friend, chatting for hours on end. She knows me better than anyone. A new
                connection after years of being single. We enjoyed our time together, time apart was spent waiting till
                the next time we see each other. Before meeting her, I grew comfortable being alone and keeping things to
                myself. This doesn't work when you get into a relationship. It messes with how you think and approach
                issues. I had trouble communicating and expressing my love and stress. I don't know if I'm ready to talk
                about this, but I feel like I need to write things out. At the end of our relationship, I
                clung on to my own feelings and what I wanted. I was selfish. We didn't want the same things anymore.
                She wants to find someone who never makes her question whether they love her or not. We tried hard for us
                to work, so much went into it. I made promises I failed to keep. She had had enough. I think I understand why
                she chose to stop waiting for me. It must have been really hard for her. I put her through a lot. I made
                her feel alone, and I wasn't there for her. I pushed her away when I had problems, and all she wanted to
                do was love and care for me. I regret everything. She probably feels betrayed. She feels hurt. The best
                thing I could do for her is to let her live her life and experience love the way she deserves to
                experience it. I have a bit of anger towards myself. I failed to love her, and I caused her pain. She
                wanted to love me, but she knows it isn't fair to her. I spent this last week trying to find a way to
                make us work and running from the end. I saw her for the last time yesterday. She looked beautiful as
                always. We met at a place she loves and where we had a couple of dates. She waited for me as I got there
                a little late. She told me what she needs from me. She needs for us to end. It's not fair to hold her
                back. We left the place and outside of her place, I said goodbye. I told her that, yeah, it isn't fair to
                her. If I really loved her I'd want the best for her. She doesn't want to continue whatever we were
                doing, and I have to respect that. A relationship needs 2 people, and it can't work if one person doesn't
                want it. Hugging her made me feel full of emotion. I got to feel her warmth one last time, the last time feeling love from her. It was hard for us
                both, she hugged me tightly. We gave each other one last kiss and wished each other the best. I did what
                love told me to do. To let her go. I'm going to miss you. I learned a lot from you, you showed me how to
                love. I can't wait to grow and give someone the love you gave me. I know your life will be full of
                love, and I love you for being part of my life A.T. -Angel </p>
